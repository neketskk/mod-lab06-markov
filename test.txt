All your life you have trained
for the day ahead of you
and this day is the imagining
of the next day
of the next week
of the next war.
And the budget is never enough
but it has to be enough.
The draft numbers are never enough
but they have to be enough
and somewhere between
a line is drawn
stopping short
of the right answer.
Scan the sky and the sea
and the ground,
intercept communications,
speak to the spies,
look for the signs,
defensive offensive defense,
the retaliation-response-ratio,
Write the plan
in the Book of Plans.
Send for the savants
of strategy.
Tell them to forget
the last war,
the weapons have changed
and you shall not
covet your neighbor weapon.
